## About appworks.js

appworks.js is a javascript (TypeScript) library for building feature rich, hybrid enterprise apps. The OpenText AppWorks platform provides mobile and desktop clients that support apps that utilize appworks.js.

In a mobile environment the library provides access to on-device technology, and in the desktop environment some features of the underlying host OS (operating system) are exposed.

For more information, see the appworks.js repository: https://github.com/opentext/appworks-js

## About this example

The purpose of the AWVibration plugin is to trigger a device vibration.

## Usage

#### vibrate

```javascript
vibrate(time: int)
```

Create an instance of AWVibration and call the vibrate function to trigger a device vibration.

+ __time__: the number of milliseconds the device will vibrate for (android only), set to zero for default, which is 500.

var v = new Appworks.AWVibration();

// Call vibration(time: int)
v.vibrate(100);
```

#### mobile.zip

This is your web content, such as html, js, css, images and any other assets.
The only essential file in your mobile.zip is index.html, which will be loaded by the appworks webview. Any other files or structure is up to the developer.

##### index.html

When your app is downloaded and installed in an appworks client, the client will place appworks.js, cordova.js and the cordova plugins in the root of your app.

In your html file, please include the following tags before any other javascript tags:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="appworks.js"></script>
```

#### Zipping and Deploying
1. Zip up the web content into a file named mobile.zip
